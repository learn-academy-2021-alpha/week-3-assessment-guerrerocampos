## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Ruby--- a programming language
- Object oriented programming----- writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data.
- RSpec---- a testing tool for Ruby.
- Instance variable---- a variable which is declared in a class but outside of constructors, methods, or blocks
- Ruby blocks------anonymous functions that can be passed into methods.
- Ruby hashes-----  A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like this: "employee" = > "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.
